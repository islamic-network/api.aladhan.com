# AlAdhan API - api.aladhan.com

This repository powers the AlAdhan.com API on http://api.aladhan.com.

# Technology Stack
* PHP 8.2
* Memcached 1.6
* Kipchak (https://github.com/mamluk/kipchak)
* 7x APIs (https://7x.ax)

### Running the App

The api and all its dependencies are fully Dockerised. You **just need docker and docker-compose** to spin everything up.

You should enter your 7x API key in the docker-compose file on line 15.

A production ready Docker image of the app is published as:

* ghcr.io/islamic-network/api.aladhan.com on GitHub Container Registry
* quay.io/islamic-network/api.aladhan.com on Quay

To get your own instance up, simply run:

```
docker-compose up
``` 

This will bring up several containers:

1. aladhan_api - This is the actual PHP / Apache instance. This runs on http://localhost - see http://localhost/status.
3. aladhan_memcached - This is the Memcached Container.

#### Build and Contribute

**Please note that the Dockerfile included builds a production ready container which has opcache switched on and xdebug turned off, so you will only see your changes every 5 minutes if you are developing. To actively develop, change the ```FROM ghcr.io/islamic-network/php:8.1-apache``` line to ```FROM ghcr.io/islamic-network/php:8.1-apache-dev```.**

With the above ```docker-compose up``` command your code is mapped to the aa-app docker container. You can make any changes and simply refresh the page to see them in real-time.

Please run ```composer install``` from within the container or on your machine because the first time to you run ```docker-compose up```, your empty vendor directory will overwrite what is in the container.

## Scaling and Sizing

This app takes 19 MB per apache process / worker and is set to have a maximum of 16 Apache workers.

A single instance should be sized with a maximum of 356 MB RAM, after which you should scale it horizontally.

## Contributing Code 

You can contribute code by raising a pull request.

There's a backlog of stuff under issues for things that potentially need to be worked on, so please feel free to pick something up from there or contribute your own improvements.
